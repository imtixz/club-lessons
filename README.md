# Boilerplate-Django-Heroku

A boilerplate or template for a django project that is created with the intention of hosting it on heroku.

## Getting Started - Installation

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

Clone the project. Change origin to a repository on your account. Install a virtual environment. Install all the dependencies from the requirements.txt file. Set a value of the environment key, 'SECRET_KEY' to something and set the value of 'DEBUG_VALUE' to 'True'.

## Deployment

Create an app on heroku. Set the environment variblaes to an appropirate value. Go to the deploy option. Select deploy with github. Connect to your github repository. And then deploy the master (or whichever branch you want to deploy).
